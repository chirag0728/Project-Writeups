## 🧭 Roadmap

To structure my journey, I’ve created a roadmap that ensures I cover all essential aspects of cybersecurity:

1. **Programming Foundations**
   - Master **C** and **Python** for low-level and scripting tasks.
   - Build real-world projects in both languages.

2. **Penetration Testing**
   - Complete challenges on **Hack The Box**, **TryHackMe**, and **VulnHub**.
   - Develop custom tools for automation and reconnaissance.

3. **Exploit Development**
   - Focus on buffer overflows, format strings, and reverse engineering.
   - Write proof-of-concept exploits.

4. **Embedded Warfare**
   - Analyze IoT firmware and hardware vulnerabilities.
   - Develop offensive tools for embedded systems.
